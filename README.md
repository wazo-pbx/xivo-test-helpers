## Environment variables

### Logging

Tests that use the AssetLaunchTestCase class will be stripped of some logs. To restore the default
logging levels, set the environment variable:

    TEST_LOGS=verbose

### Docker containers management

In some cases, it is easier to manage Docker containers manually or via an external script. When
doing that, the tests must be told to not manage the containers and this is done with the variable:

    TEST_DOCKER=ignore
